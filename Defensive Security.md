#Defensive security
## What is defensive security?
Defensive security is the practice of defending, protecting systems and devices from unauthorized access and protecting organizations's physical and digitals assets from attack.
It is also known as the blue team.

## Goal:
- To ensure CIA triad of data(CIA Triad will be discussed latter)
- To prevent data from intrusions
- To detect intrusion earlier 
- Focus on monitoring, detecting and response

### Why we need Blue teamer or Defensive security
-Blue teamer monitor, detect and response. 

## Tasks which are related to BLue team:
- User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps reduce attacks
- Documenting and managing assets: We must know what devices and systems we own, manage and protect
- Updating and patching systems:  keep the system up to date ensure that computers, servers and network devices are correctly updated and they fixes the known vulnerabilities that attacker could get advantages. Patching a system reduces the risk of malware, data beaches and system compromise.
- Setting up preventive security devices: It mean that setting up security devices like firewalls and IPS(Intrusion PRevention system) helps in preventing the system from intrusions.


## More Defensive related roles
- Security Operation Center (SOC)
      - Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensic and Incident Response (DFIR)
      - Malware Analysis

Will be discussed below in details.

## SOC: 
SOC is a dedicated tem of cyber security where professionals monitor the network and the systems to detect  and analyze the malicious activities.

## The main responsibilities of SOC team are:
### Vulnerabilities: 
Vulnerability is the weakness in a system or its a loopholes. Whenever a system discover it. It is very important to fix the vulnerabilities by updating the patches and when there is no available  update its necessary for soc team to take a steps to prevent it from attackers.

### Policy violation:
Policy is a set of rules in security system for the purpose of protecting data.
Example: Someone leaking organization confidential data out side the company thats mean that he/she violates the rules and policy. and this is monitor by soc team.

### Unauthorized Activity: 
Whenever user's credentials are compromised and someone uses the credentials in order to misuse the data.This is the work of SOC team to detect it and block that type of events before more damage occurs.

### Network Intrusion:
Someone clicking on the malicious link by clicking on it the security of network must be compromised this is the work of soc team to detect it and response it.

## Threat Intelligence: 
Intelligence mean collecting information about attacker and threat refers to any action in which attacker want to access a system and harm the system. Threat intelligence is the process of collecting and analyzing information about attackers.
Companies has different adversaries(Attackers/enemies) who want different assets . Some wants data of customer 
Adversaries choose target based on what the benefits more.
Intelligence needs data and data is collected, processed and analyze. Data is collected from different areas and resources like online available information, forums in order to know about the threat actors(adversaries) and their TTP's and predict their activities so we can find the defensive solution for it.

## Digital Forensic and Incident Response (DFIR):
It is the blue team of cybersecurity which cover two main part/sides.
Forensic refers to investigating the system, crime and establish facts.

## Digital Forensic:
Digital forensic is all about finding the evidence after incidents in digital systems like smartphones, computers and digital devices. in earlier time it is known from computer forensic then evolved to digital forensics.
the goal is to understand what happened , how it happened and who was involved.
In defensive security digital forensic is about investigating cyber attacks to understand what happen and identifying perpetrators and the motivation behind it.
Digital forensic will focus on different areas such as;

- file system
- system memory 
- system logs
- network logs

## Incident Response: in cyber security incident means data breaches or cyber attack;
however sometime it will minor like misconfiguration, failed login attack or policy violation .
incident response is the process of handling the cyber attack in order to minimize the lose and recover system data quickly.

### The Four major phases of the incident response are:

1. Preparation: Get ready for everything happened which requires a trained team who are ready to handle incident.

2. Detection and analysis: The team has resources to detect and analyze the incident like SEIM Tools.

3. Containment , Eradication and Recovery:  Containment mean stop the incident,Eradication mean clean from malware and recovery mean we recover the lose

4. Post-Incident Activity: Make an incident report for future to understand the data breach and learn lesson from the incident.

## Malware Analysis:
Malware stands for malicious software and software mean a set of program to perform a specific task 
malware have some types;

### Virus:
A virus is a piece of code which is attached with program and spread into devices and works by altering, overwriting and deleting a files once it affect a computer.
### Trojan Horse :
A type of malware which show itself as a legitimate program but hide malicious function inside.
### Ransomware: 
A type of malware that encrypt the user's files, Encryption make the files unreadable and without encryption key the won't be open and the attackers offer ransom to provide that key/password.

Malware analysis is understanding what malware does , how it work and how to stop it.
There are two type of malware analysis
Static malware which mean without running the malware analyze it while dynamic is to run malware in control environment and monitoring its activities and observe how malware behave.
